  <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete, usually expressed as a function of the input size efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses, usually expressed as a functional O(n).</p>
